This is the official website of the workshop on geostatistical methods for population health scientists delivered online by the Tropical Disease Epidemiology group at the Centre for Health Informatics Computing and Statistics in Lancaster University, on 20-22 April 2021. The convenors of the workshop are: [Dr Benjamin Amoah](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/amoah.html), [Dr Claudio Fronterre](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/fronterre.html), [Dr Olatunji Johnson](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/johnsono.html), [Dr Emanuele Giorgi](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/giorgi.html) and [Prof Peter Diggle](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/diggle.html). 

 
## Course structure

With a mix of lectures and lab sessions, the first two days of the workshop will introduce the underpinning concepts of model-based geostatistics and how to use geostatistical models to address public health problems. The lab sessions will be based on a user friendly Shiny app developed in the R software environment. 

On the third day of the workshop, participants will be given the opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own projects that address public health questions requiring the use of spatial statistical methods.
